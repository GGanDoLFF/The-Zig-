Actually I made this to learn python &amp; Telegram bot API

But now its going furthur than learning python xD

Special thanks to Iman Daneshi that gave me the idea to learn python.. lol..

# Installation

To install the bot, executes theese commands one by one:

```
git clone https://github.com/WebShark025/MySimpleFirstPythonBot
cd MySimpleFirstPythonBot
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

Launch the bot once: `./launch.sh` then stop it (`Ctrl + C`)

A Copy of `locale.py.new` & `config.py.new` will be maken => `locale.py` & `config.py`. 

Edit those as you need.

Then launch the bot normaly. To do it, simply execute `./launch.sh`
